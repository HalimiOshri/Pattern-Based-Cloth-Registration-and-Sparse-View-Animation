# Pattern-Based-Cloth-Registration-and-Sparse-View-Animation

* This repo provides the implementation code for the paper: "Pattern Based Cloth Registration and Sparse View Animation".
* Link to [arxiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03373) of the paper.
* We implement the following modules: pattern registration part (section 4) and cloth animation model (section 6)
* The paper data and additional data captured later are available in the following link: [registeration_data](https://github.com/facebookresearch/PatternedClothing).
The data includes ~15k frames of shirt captured on 4 different subjects, and 2k frames of skirt in a single subject.
* The cloth pattern is available in these files: `ColorPatternDetection\color_pattern_files\300-900\board.png` and `ColorPatternDetection\color_pattern_files\200-600\board.png`, for the small and big pattern, respectively.
